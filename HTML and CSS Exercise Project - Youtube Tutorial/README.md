## HTML and CSS Exercise Project

Welcome to my HTML and CSS exercise project! This project was inspired by a tutorial on creating a YouTube visual clone and serves as a practice exercise to reinforce the concepts learned during an online tutorial.

### Project Details

This project, developed as part of an HTML and CSS exercise course, allowed me to apply the skills acquired during the course to build a small-scale project. The project closely follows the structure and design elements of a YouTube page, providing an opportunity to practice HTML and CSS fundamentals.

#### Project Goals:
- Implement HTML structure and elements to mimic a YouTube page layout.
- Apply CSS styling to replicate the visual appearance of various page components, such as headers, navigation bars, video thumbnails, and footer sections.
- Practice responsive design principles to ensure the project displays properly across different devices and screen sizes.
