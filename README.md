# CodePractice

Welcome to my CodePractice repository! Here you'll find a collection of exercises and small projects that I've been working on to improve my skills as a junior full-stack developer. This repository serves as a playground where I experiment and learn new things.

## What's Inside?

Inside this repository, you'll discover:

- **JavaScript Exercises:** Small coding challenges and exercises to sharpen my JavaScript skills.
- **React Mini-Projects:** Simple React projects to reinforce my understanding of React concepts.
- **Vue.js Explorations:** Projects experimenting with Vue.js to build dynamic user interfaces.
- **HTML/CSS Demos:** Demonstrations of HTML and CSS techniques.
- **Node.js Projects:** Examples of server-side development using Node.js and Express.
- **TypeScript Explorations:** Experimentations with TypeScript to familiarize myself with its syntax and features.

- **Online Tutorials:** Projects created following online tutorials to apply and practice learned concepts.

## How to Use?

If you're also interested of the technologies I've used here or just curious about the projects I've been working on, you can clone this repository to your local machine and dive into the code. Each project is contained within its own folder and comes with its own README file for instructions on how to run or use it.
