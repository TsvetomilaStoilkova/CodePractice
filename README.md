# CodePractice

Welcome to my CodePractice repository! Here you'll find a collection of exercises and small projects that I've been working on to improve my skills as a junior front-end developer. This repository serves as a playground where I experiment and learn new staff.

## What's Inside?

Inside this repository, you'll discover:

- **JavaScript Exercises:** Small coding challenges and exercises to sharpen my JavaScript skills.
- **ReactJS Mini-Projects:** Simple ReactJS projects to reinforce my understanding of React concepts.
- **HTML/CSS Demos:** Demonstrations of HTML and CSS techniques, including responsive design and layout tricks.
- **Firebase Integration Examples:** Projects integrating Firebase for backend functionalities like authentication, database management, and hosting.
- **TypeScript Explorations:** Experimentations with TypeScript to familiarize myself with its syntax and features.

Feel free to explore the folders and projects within this repository. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome!

## How to Use?

If you're also learning front-end development or just curious about the projects I've been working on, you can clone this repository to your local machine and dive into the code. Each project is contained within its own folder and comes with its own README file for instructions on how to run or use it.
